## Introduction
Mistral 7B is a super-smart language model with 7 billion parameters! It beats the best 13B model, Llama 2, in all tests and even outperforms the powerful 34B model, Llama 1, in reasoning, math, and code generation. How? Mistral 7B uses smart tricks like grouped-query attention (GQA) for quick thinking and sliding window attention (SWA) to handle all sorts of text lengths without slowing down.

And there's more! Mistral AI Team fine-tuned Mistral 7B for specific tasks with Mistral 7B – Instruct. It not only outshines Llama 2 13B in chat but also rocks both human and automated tests. Best part? Mistral 7B – was released under the Apache 2.0 license.
